A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/chrysostomos-marasinou/pen/VxZZzo.

Make your own version of Marco Rubio's TIME magazine cover with SCSS + jQuery and save it as a PNG image with html2canvas.

Looks best when the text fills exactly three lines, like the original, but I didn't put restrictions on text length in case you feel like filling the entire magazine. I'm a pen, not a cop.

Inspired by edits tweeted by @darth and Chris Yarie. Input styles forked from a pen by Dan Smith
